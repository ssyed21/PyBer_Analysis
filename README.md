# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to find out how the inputted data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by the decision makers at PyBer 

## Results
There are significantly more urban drivers than suburban and rural city types. Also the total rides in urban city types is significantly higher than suburban and rural city types. But the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is significantly lower in urban areas than in rural, where it is the highest in both categories, and suburban city types. The link below shows the data chart.

## Summary
Based on the analysis the CEO should look to increasing tha mount of drivers in rural and suburban areas. Another recommendation is to lower the cost of fares for rural and suburban areas as that may be a key indicator to why there are significantly less drivers and rides. The third recommendation is that marketing should be focused on giving discounts to rural and suburban area users as that will likely drive more people to use the service.
